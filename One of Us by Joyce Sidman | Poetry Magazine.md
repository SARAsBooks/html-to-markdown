# One of Us by Joyce Sidman | Poetry Magazine

“That kid is weird,” says  

the teacher, flipping her shining hair.  

“I don’t know where he’s at.”  

Indeed, he is quiet  

in the way of a giraffe:  

ears tuned to something we can’t hear.  

He turns his sleepy eyes on me—  

chocolate brown  

with long, extraordinary lashes—  

as I hand him a seashell:  

something to write about, you know,  

something to focus on.  

Suddenly, silently,  

in the mysterious way of  poetry,  

he is at  

           that shell,  

he is in it,  

his heart fills up with it.  

_O Shell,_ he writes,  

_you make lizards dance_  

_in the sky with birds._  

_Never leave me, Shell._  

During sharing time,  

he reads his poem aloud—  

reverently,  

almost to himself.  

Half the class is stunned,  

half embarrassed.  

The teacher shakes her head.  

I am barely breathing.  

_One of  us,_ I sing, _one of  us!_
